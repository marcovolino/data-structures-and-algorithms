An **algorithm** is a step-by-step set of instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a problem. It takes input, processes it through a series of defined steps, and produces an output. Algorithms can be simple, like adding two numbers, or complex, like sorting data or finding the shortest path in a graph. They are fundamental to programming and computer science, enabling efficient problem-solving and decision-making. A good algorithm is efficient, correct, and optimized for time and space.
